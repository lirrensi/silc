## Code Map
`docs/` contains the codebase map
- `docs/CODEMAP.L1.md` — Compact index (line-first names and line numbers)
- `docs/CODEMAP.L2.md` — Detailed index (line-first full signatures with parameters and return types)

You may read entire L1 file as a quick reference.
L2 file may be big - prefer using `rg` or partial reads to refer to specific files/modules.
